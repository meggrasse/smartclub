# SmartClub

Using the IoT paradigm to bring user feedback to the clubbing experience. 

This project offers two contributions:

1. Passively senses crowd emotion, performing sentiment on location and audio data.
2. Predicts which track a crowd would prefer to hear next in a clubbing environment.

More specific technical information available in each module's repo.
